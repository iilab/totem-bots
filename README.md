Totem Bots
----------

This repository contains bots that will be used in the Totem Digital Security Mooc project to help validate practically the results of learning units.

This is based on @stef's work for the Ononymous Game https://game.ononymous.org

# In progress

    - Bot initiated encryption and SMP dance.
    - User initiatied encryption and SMP dance.

# Todo

 - OTR
   - Multi device scenario
   - Interception scenario
 - GPG
 - SSL MITM
 - ... 

# Other ideas

 - Make these bots deployable on PaaS-like platforms (heroku, digital ocean)
 - Make these bots usable as "echo-tests" to help anyone do basic sanity check on client app basic features and security features.
