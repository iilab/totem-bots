this needs a patched mcabber to run, get it from:
https://github.com/stef/mcabber

or patch your own mcabber with this:
patch:
https://github.com/stef/mcabber/commit/d63087ba2a51410edab5b065054c780a1ee46d3b

furthermore you also need
http://hg.isbear.org.ua/hg/isbear/mcabber-eventcmd-ng/

when you compile mcabber, also compile the fifo module.
