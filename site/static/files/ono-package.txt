Sorry, I had to remove the file that was here because this site suffered from
censorship in a severe denial of service attacks. I put the file on a Onion-site
since it's practically impossible to censor such sites or attack them directly,
so I think your file should be save there.

If you want to access the Onion, please install the Tor Browser and go to 
http://hftpdlb256qd3z5a.onion You can find the file there.

The good thing is, Tor will also anonymize your traffic online and the Tor
Browser will force sites to use HTTPS where possible.

Good luck.

The Administrator

P.S. You can find the installer and instructions here:
