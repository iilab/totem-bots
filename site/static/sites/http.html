    <p>Welcome at the unsafe version of the robotdropbox. Only silly and reckless robots drop their files here. You know why? Because everyone could see what the robots would be uploading or downloading. That's because this site is running as HTTP. Everyone who has access to the network which you are on can intercept this traffic; passwords, files, pictures and more.</p>

    <p>If you want to make sure that this is not happening, please use the HTTPS version of this site, by changing http:// into http<span style="color: red;">s</span>:// in the address bar above. When you use HTTPS, the traffic is encrypted.</p>
