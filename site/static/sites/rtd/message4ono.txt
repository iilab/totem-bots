Dear Friend,

I'm impressed by your commitment and skills. You have come very far. You are almost a digital comms ninja. There are two more steps we need to make together. You'll need to decrypt this file and send it to me.

In order to do this, please install PGP [HOWTO] and ask me for the password via Jabber by typing 'password' (without the quotes).

Then paste the content of the decrypted file into the jabber chat.
