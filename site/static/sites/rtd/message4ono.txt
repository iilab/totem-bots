Dear Friend,

I'm impressed by your commitment and skills. You have come very far. You are almost a digital comms ninja. There are two more steps we need to make together. You'll need to decrypt this file and send it to me.

To decrypt, you will need PGP software.  Find some more information here:

Encrypting/Decrypting files with PGP/GPG - https://wiki.onorobot.org/doku.php?id=encrypting_decrypting_files_with_pgp_gpg

In order to do this, please install PGP and ask me for the password via Jabber by typing 'password' (without the quotes).

At the bottom of this file is the encrypted text.  You will need to copy this into a file to decrypt it.  Here is the encrypted message:

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
