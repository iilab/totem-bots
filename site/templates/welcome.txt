Hello {{ip}}{%if country %} from {{country}}{%endif%},

I need your help. I know you are worried about your digital security, so am I. And frankly, I'm also worried about mine. I have been remembering things lately from my previous robotic life, gruesomely effective surveillance techniques and advanced digital attacks. I need to put the pieces back together, to help people who are potentially at risk. To do that I need access to certain websites. But I've noticed that many of these sites are blocked in my country, Secure-a-lot. Can you help me to get the right information and learn somethings about safe and secure digital communications along the way?

Let's first steps to setup a secure chat account so we can talk more comfortably, skip any steps that you already have working: Please go to register.jabber.org and register an account there. Now install jitsi (http://jit.si), login to your Jabber account, add me (username ono@jabber.ccc.de) as a friend and shoot me a message.

thanks a lot!
Ono
