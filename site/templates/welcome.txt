Hello {{ip}} from {{country}},

I need your help. I know you are worried about your digital security, so am I. And frankly, I'm also worried about mine. I have been remembering things lately from my previous robotic life, gruesomely effective surveillance techniques and advanced digital attacks. I need to put the pieces back together, to help people who are potentially at risk. To do that I need access to certain websites. But I've noticed that many of these sites are blocked in my country, Secure-a-lot. Can you help me to get the right information and learn somethings about safe and secure digital communications along the way?

Let's first steps to setup a secure chat account so we can talk more comfortably. Please go to register.jabber.org and register an account there. Now install Adium (Mac), Pidgin (Windows https://securityinabox.org/en/pidgin_securechat 3.1 ), Empathy (linux), login to your Jabber account, add me (username Ono) as a friend and shoot me a message. The secret is: privacyis!hard
